# Privacy Policy for Minimalist YouTube Chrome Extension

Effective Date: 15/01/2025

## Introduction
Thank you for installing the Minimalist YouTube Chrome Extension (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and safeguard your privacy while using the Extension. Your trust is important to us, and we are committed to ensuring transparency and security.

## Information We Collect
The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data. All actions performed by the Extension occur locally in your browser.

## Permissions and Scope
The Extension requires the following permissions:
- **Web Request**: To access and modify the structure of YouTube pages for a more minimalistic interface.
- **Content Scripts**: To inject JavaScript into YouTube pages to hide unnecessary elements.

These permissions are strictly used to customize the YouTube interface as described and do not enable the Extension to collect or share data.

## How the Extension Works
The Extension uses a content script to:
- Remove specific elements from YouTube pages (e.g., ads, comments, and other distracting features).
- Redirect the YouTube homepage to the "Subscriptions" feed for a cleaner experience.

All modifications are performed locally on your device and are not transmitted over the internet.

## Data Sharing
The Extension does not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services that collect or process your data.

## Security
The Extension operates locally and does not interact with any external servers. Updates are securely distributed via the Chrome Web Store.

## Cookies and Local Storage
The Extension does not use cookies or local storage. It only interacts with the YouTube DOM (Document Object Model) to modify the appearance and behavior of the site.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes to the Extension or applicable regulations. Any updates will be posted here with an updated "Effective Date." We encourage you to review this policy regularly.

Thank you for using the Minimalist YouTube Chrome Extension!
